This is a PVR Add-on for XBMC to add vu+ DVRs as a TV/PVR Backend to XBMC.

It want to add support for Live TV watching, replaying of Recordings, programming Timers and
EPG TV Guide to use over the Network.

For parsing the XML output from the VU+ webinterface it uses the xmlParser library developed by Frank Vanden Berghen (http://www.applied-mathematics.net/tools/xmlParser.html). The build scripts are based on Alexander Pipelka's xbmc-addon-xvdr. Many thanks for this!
